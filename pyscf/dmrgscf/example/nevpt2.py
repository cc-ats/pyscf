'''
DMRG-CASCI then DMRG-NEVPT2 calculation.

There are two NEVPT2 implementations available for DMRG Block program.  The slow
version (default) strictly follows the formula presented in JCP 117, 9138 (2012); DOI:10.1063/1.1515317
in which the 4-particle density matrix is explictly computed.  Typically 26
orbitals is the upper limit of the slow version due to the large requirements
on the memory usage.  The fast version employs the so called MPS-pertuber
technique.  It is able to handle much larger systems, up to about 30 orbitals.
