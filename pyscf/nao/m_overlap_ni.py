      Computes overlap for an atom pair. The atom pair is given by a pair of species indices
      and the coordinates of the atoms.
      Args: 
        sp1,sp2 : specie indices, and
        R1,R2 :   respective coordinates in Bohr, atomic units
      Result:
        matrix of orbital overlaps
      The procedure uses the numerical integration in coordinate space.
